Our goal is to create a welcoming space where people can connect, find opportunities to perform, and grow as artists.

We regularly share a monthly newsletter highlighting indie shows, jams, workshops, and community updates, helping improvisers stay informed and connected. Our WhatsApp network is an active space where members promote their shows, form practice groups, and support one another.

While we occasionally partner with local instructors or performers to offer workshops or host shows, our primary focus is community-building: uplifting indie teams, promoting local events, and creating spaces (online and in person) where improvisers can collaborate, belong, and thrive.
