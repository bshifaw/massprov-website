MassProv is a non-profit organization committed to enriching the Greater Boston community through the power of improv comedy. We partner with local theaters to offer free and low-cost workshops, classes, and shows, making the art of improvisation accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. By fostering creativity, collaboration, and confidence, we aim to create a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals can explore their artistic potential and build meaningful connections.
