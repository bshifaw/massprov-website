MassProv is a community of improvisers dedicated to enriching the Greater Boston area through the art of improv comedy. We collaborate with local independent performers and instructors to offer free and low-cost workshops, classes, and shows, making improvisation accessible to people of all ages and backgrounds. By fostering creativity, collaboration, and confidence, we aim to create a supportive and inclusive environment where individuals can explore their artistic potential and build meaningful connections.
