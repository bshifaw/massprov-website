description: "Guidelines for keeping MassProv welcoming, safe, and supportive."
---

MassProv exists to support a warm, welcoming improv community across Massachusetts. Most of our community lives in our WhatsApp groups, and we want those spaces to feel safe, inclusive, and supportive for everyone.

### What this group is for

- Sharing shows, jams, and improv opportunities
- Asking questions, swapping advice, and sharing resources
- Building community and supporting each other

### How we expect people to behave

- Be respectful. Talk to people the way you’d want to be talked to, in chat and in person.
- Include others. Make space for different voices and experiences.
- No harassment or discrimination. That includes sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise targeted language or behavior.
- Keep conflicts humane. It’s okay to disagree; it’s not okay to attack, insult, or dogpile a person.
- Respect boundaries and consent. In scenes, physical contact, and social interactions, check in and back off if someone seems uncomfortable.

### Not okay in MassProv spaces

Examples of behavior that may lead to moderation or removal:

- Harassment, stalking, or intimidation (online or in person)
- Slurs, hate speech, or repeated derogatory comments about someone’s identity
- Sexual harassment or unwanted sexual attention
- Threats, doxxing, or encouraging others to harass someone
- Repeatedly aggressive, disruptive, or hostile behavior that makes others feel unsafe in MassProv spaces

If you have a serious concern about someone, please bring it to an organizer directly rather than in the group chat.

### If you have a concern or experience harm

You can email the organizers (or use the contact form) or DM a MassProv organizer.

Share as much or as little detail as you’re comfortable with. We’ll do our best to keep what you share as private as possible and prioritize your safety.

### How organizers may respond

When something is reported or noticed, we focus on concrete behavior in MassProv spaces (WhatsApp, events, workshops, jams). We may:

- Check in with the people involved to get more context
- Give a private warning or ask someone to adjust their behavior
- Temporarily or permanently remove someone from WhatsApp groups
- Ask someone not to attend MassProv events or activities

MassProv organizers reserve the right to limit or revoke someone’s participation in MassProv spaces when we believe it’s necessary to protect the safety and well-being of the community.
